# Epileptic_Seizure_Detection_ML using ANN algorithm
In this work, a novel method based on multiwavelet transform and approximate entropy is proposed for classifying the EEG data into normal/non-seizure and epileptic. The raw EEG data is firstly decomposed into several sub-signals through MWT, then the approximate entropy feature is extracted for each sub-signal to form a feature vector. Finally, the constructed feature vector is put as input to an artificial neural network to classify the EEG into normal/non-seizure and seizure. T
